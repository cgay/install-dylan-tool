# To test changes to the install-dylan-tool Action we choose an arbitrary
# project (pacman-catalog) to build and test. Unfortunately, this will only run
# AFTER something is pushed to the "main" branch. Not sure how to fix that, but
# it's not a big problem since no one will use it until a specific version is
# tagged.
